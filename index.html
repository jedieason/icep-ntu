                    <h3>National Taiwan University College of Medicine</h3>
                    <h4>A Legacy of Excellence in Asian Healthcare</h4>
                    <p><strong>Overview</strong><br>The National Taiwan University College of Medicine (NTUCM) stands as
                        the premier institution for medical education and research in Taiwan. Located in the heart of
                        Taipei, it is the cornerstone of the National Taiwan University (NTU) system—the most
                        prestigious comprehensive university in the nation. For over a century, NTUCM has served as the
                        cradle of Taiwan’s medical leadership, dedicated to cultivating elite physicians and scientists
                        who drive the advancement of global health.</p>

                    <h3>A Century of Heritage</h3>
                    <p>The history of NTUCM mirrors the evolution of modern medicine in Taiwan. Its origins date back to
                        1897 with the founding of the Medical Training Institute. It was later established as the
                        Faculty of Medicine under Taihoku Imperial University in 1936 during the Japanese era, and
                        subsequently renamed National Taiwan University College of Medicine in 1945. The campus itself
                        is a testament to this rich history. The original medical building, a designated historic
                        monument built in the Renaissance style, stands in dialogue with modern research facilities,
                        symbolizing the college's philosophy: a commitment to scientific innovation grounded in deep
                        humanistic traditions.</p>

                    <h3>Pioneering Contributions to Global Medicine</h3>
                    <p>NTUCM and its teaching hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), have long been
                        recognized as a hub for groundbreaking medical achievements that have influenced healthcare
                        protocols worldwide:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hepatitis Control & Liver Disease:</strong> NTUCM is world-renowned for its pivotal
                            role in the fight against Hepatitis. The research team led by Professors Beasley and Chen
                            Ding-shing proved the vertical transmission pathway of the Hepatitis B virus. This discovery
                            laid the scientific foundation for Taiwan to launch the world’s first universal Hepatitis B
                            vaccination program in 1984—a public health triumph that has since been adopted globally to
                            prevent liver cancer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Snake Venom Research:</strong> Since the mid-20th century, the Pharmacological
                            Institute at NTUCM has been a global leader in snake venom research. These studies have not
                            only saved lives through antivenom development but have also isolated key proteins used in
                            studying blood coagulation and nerve transmission mechanisms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clinical Innovation:</strong> The institution remains at the forefront of critical
                            care and surgery, boasting world-class achievements in organ transplantation, microsurgery,
                            and ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) applications.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="info-block" id="info-4">
                    <h3>Taiwan’s Role in the International Medical Community</h3>
                    <p>Situated at a critical geographic and technological nexus in Asia, Taiwan offers a unique
                        environment for medical study. The nation is celebrated for its National Health Insurance (NHI)
                        system, which provides universal coverage with high efficiency and accessibility, frequently
                        ranked among the best in the world. Furthermore, Taiwan’s robust IT industry allows for the
                        seamless integration of smart medicine and big data analytics into clinical practice.</p>
                    <p>As the leading medical institution in this dynamic environment, NTUCM continues to bridge East
                        and West, combining advanced biomedical technology with comprehensive public health strategies.
                        It remains a vital partner in the international medical community, committed to solving the
                        health challenges of the 21st century.</p>
